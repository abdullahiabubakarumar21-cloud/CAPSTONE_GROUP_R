Fall Armyworm Detection and Leaf Classification Using Deep Learning

                           Project Description

The Fall Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) is a destructive pest that poses a serious threat to maize and other crops across Africa and other tropical regions. Early detection and accurate classification of infected leaves are crucial for timely intervention and minimizing crop loss. Traditional detection methods rely on manual inspection, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error.

This project aims to develop an automated deep learning-based system capable of detecting Fall Armyworm infestation and classifying maize leaf conditions (healthy, presence of larva, or infected) using image data. The system leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) — a powerful class of deep learning models — to learn visual patterns and distinguish between healthy and diseased leaves.

A dataset of maize leaf images, containing both infested and non-infested samples, is used for model training and validation. Pre-trained models such as MobileNetV2 was fine-tuned to enhance performance and reduce computational cost. The trained model outputs the probability of infection and classifies each leaf image accordingly.

The project also includes data preprocessing steps such as image augmentation, resizing, and normalization to improve model generalization. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Ultimately, the system provides a reliable and efficient tool for early pest detection, helping farmers and agricultural experts take prompt action and reduce yield loss. This research contributes to smart agriculture by integrating artificial intelligence with crop protection techniques.
